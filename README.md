Some basic notes:

1- after you run the server you can use sign_in, sign_up, and home page
  1.1- sign_in and sign_up in the same URL which is localhost:8000
  1.2- for the home page you must use localhost:8000/home
  
2- I have made a database you can see it in the admin dashboard
  2.1- you should make a new password and username for you to do that by typing "python manage.py createsuperuser"
  2.2- I didn't have time to take a real object from the registration page so I made on using CLI
  
3- what should you do?
  3.1- make sure you can continue from where I stopped
  3.2- you can complete on the home page by adding a video viewer - you will be understood from the dashboard what we have to complete-
  3.3- if you want to complete on the DB no problem - I mean here by taking records from the registration page and insert them in the DB-
